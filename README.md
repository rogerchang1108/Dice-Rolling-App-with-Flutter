# Dice Rolling App

In this project, using Flutter and Dart to fulfill the Dice Rolling App with little game.


## Features

<br>

(1) Display the **score of each dice** roll in this round (display **"--"** if not completed),

and show how many dice have been rolled in the current five opportunities (for example, **Chance left: 4**), <br>

along with the **current total score**(for example, **Your score: 3/20**).


(2) A **progress bar** is displayed to track the distance to the **20-points** goal. 

Upon completion (**score >= 20**), the background will change to a **green gradient**, and a **congratulations message** will be displayed (e.g., 'You win'). Conversely, if not completed(**score < 20**), the background will change to a **red gradient**, and a **failure message** will be displayed (e.g., 'You lose').

Modify the dice roll button to display **"Play again"** at the end of each round to start the next round.
