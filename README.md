In this project, using Flutter and Dart to fulfill the Dice Rolling App with little game.


## Features

<br>
<br>
and show how many dice have been rolled in the current five opportunities (for example, **Chance left: 4**),
<br>
<br>
along with the **current total score**(for example, **Your score: 3/20**).
